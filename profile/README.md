## What is Amphetamine for Mac?

Amphetamine for Mac is the ultimate utility designed to prevent your Mac from sleeping, dimming, or going idle, giving you full control over your systemâ€™s activity. Built for power users, developers, and anyone needing uninterrupted Mac usage, Amphetamine allows you to keep your workflows seamless and uninterrupted.  

Amphetamine is highly customizable, offering scheduled sessions, triggers based on specific applications, and duration settings, making it ideal for tasks like downloading large files, presentations, streaming, coding, or running long simulations. Unlike traditional system preferences, Amphetamine offers granular control with a simple, user-friendly interface.  

### Why Amphetamine Stands Out:

* Prevents your Mac from sleeping or dimming without changing system settings.  
* Supports automation through triggers and session schedules.  
* Works seamlessly with macOS Ventura, Sonoma, and Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4).  
* Lightweight, unobtrusive, and optimized for minimal resource usage.  
* Perfect for developers, designers, or anyone running long tasks.  
* Integrates smoothly with Menu Bar for quick access and monitoring.  
* Offers customizable alerts, notifications, and preferences for session control.  

Whether youâ€™re running critical downloads, streaming media, performing code builds, or hosting meetings, Amphetamine ensures your Mac remains active exactly when you need it.

### Key Features:

* Schedule sessions by time, app, or device activity.  
* Toggle keep-awake mode instantly from the menu bar.  
* Smart rules to auto-start sessions when certain apps launch.  
* Supports AppleScript and automation for advanced workflows.  
* No compromise on performance â€“ runs silently in the background.  

Amphetamine empowers you to take complete control over your Macâ€™s uptime, making it the go-to solution for staying productive and efficient without interruptions.
